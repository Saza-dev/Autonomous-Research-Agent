# Autonomous-Research-Agent
n autonomous AI agent built with LangChain that can reason, plan, and use tools to answer complex research questions. It dynamically searches for scientific literature (arXiv, Google), reads and analyzes PDF content, and uses a vector-based memory (ChromaDB) to synthesize findings from multiple sources into a coherent answer.
